# AgalychnisUCE
Agalychnis (tree frog) UCE analyses

# Data
UCE data were generated by RAPiD Genomics. I obtained a copy of the data, which are stored here:

`/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/gompert-group4/data/UCE_data`

This includes UCE data for 66 individiuals (a few were miss-labeled, see notes below).

The data were provided by John Wiens, are available from [OSF](https://osf.io/fzw3x/) and were originally published in [Portik et al. 2023](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/40/5/msad109/7151539). I specifically used the data from `Final-Trimmed-Alignments.zip`. This includes 3784 UCE alignments. I extracted the sequence for *Agalychnis callidryas* for each UCE alignment (if present), removed any gaps in the alignment and then used the sequence as our reference. Our reference thus comprises 2028 *Agalychnis callidryas* reference sequences (contigs) (1,052,683 bps total).

I used archived UCE data to create a reference UCE file for alignment. This is in `/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/gompert-group4/data/UCE_data/Reference`.

The reference was indexed with `samtools` (version 1.16) and `bwa` (version 0.7.17-r1198-dirty). 

```{bash}
cd /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/gompert-group4/data/UCE_data/Reference
samtools faidx CleanUCE.fasta
bwa index CleanUCE.fasta
```
